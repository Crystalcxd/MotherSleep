"MusicIntro" = "Music, as an art form, can give people great spiritual enjoyment, and it is also an effective therapy since ancient times. The ancient Egyptian wizards often used pray and singing to relieve the pain of delivery, known as \"doctor of the soul\". Music can help to adjust both physical and mental state of human beings, relieve their tension, and also improve their physical and mental health.\nThe complicated parenting after childbirth makes mothers suffer long-term chronic fatigue and mental stress. So it selects some soothing melody and natural sounds to help mothers relax themselves and improve their sleep state, which can be also daily companion for relaxing, leisure and meditation.
